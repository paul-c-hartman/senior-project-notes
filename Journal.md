# Meeting Notes – 1/13
**Paul Hartman**
- **Git-visible accomplishments since last meeting (include time):**
	- None yet, unfortunately. I will have these starting at the next meeting. I suffered some confusion as to my specific role until a group meeting a few days ago
- **Work in progress since last meeting not yet on Git (include time):**
	- User system design decisions -- 1hr 53min
		- Have narrowed it down to either OIDC with Google/Microsoft integrations or fully managed users with username/password stored in DB
	- Re-setting up dev environment (due to unrelated circumstances) -- 1hr 32min
- **Things I need:**
	- Advice on which approach to take for user system design, ideally from Matt
	- Some sort of meeting with Matt about the project
- **Things I will do before the next meeting (or the meeting after that):**
	- Prototype user system. If it doesn't take long, I might prototype both versions so we can move forward quickly once we get feedback from Matt
	- Hook up prototype user system to pages to enforce access control
	- Set up code coverage reporting -- this overlaps with Jenessy's tasks a bit, I may not end up doing this myself
